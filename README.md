# Digital Oscilloscope

This project is a digital oscilloscope that uses a microcontroller with an ADC to sample input signals and display them in real-time on a graphical LCD display.

The project requires the following components:

A microcontroller with an ADC,
A graphical LCD display,
A power supply,
Jumper wires,
The project can be assembled using the following steps:

Connect the microcontroller to the LCD display.
Connect the power supply to the microcontroller.
Upload the code to the microcontroller.
Connect the input signal to the ADC.
Press the button to start the oscilloscope.
The oscilloscope will display the input signal in real-time on the LCD display.

The code for the oscilloscope is available on GitHub.
